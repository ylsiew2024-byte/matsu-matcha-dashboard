Issue: Duplicate header on User Management page

Looking at the screenshot:
- First header row: "User Management" | Enter Simulation Mode | Lock | Employee | CONFIDENTIAL | Bell
- Second header row: "User Management" | Enter Simulation Mode | Lock | Employee | CONFIDENTIAL | Bell

The issue is that the DashboardLayout already includes a header with the page title and SecurityToolbar.
But the content area is showing another header with the same elements.

Looking at the code:
- DashboardLayout line 344-384 has the top header bar with SecurityToolbar
- The UserManagement page at line 155 wraps content in DashboardLayout
- The "Access Denied" content is inside DashboardLayout

The duplicate appears to be coming from somewhere else - possibly the App.tsx or another wrapper.
Need to check if there's a duplicate SecurityToolbar being rendered outside of DashboardLayout.
